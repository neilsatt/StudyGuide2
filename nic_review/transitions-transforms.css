/* Quiz 1 */ 

/* 

    A time value of 500ms is equivalent to the value
        .5s


    What property defines the property, or properties, you want to transition?
        transition-property


    What property sets how long a transition should last?
        transition-duration

    Every CSS property can accept a transition.
        False, only animatable properties with identifiable halfway points can accept transitions. 

    Given the CSS below, what is the transition-duration for background?

        .card {
            transition-property: color, background, box-shadow;
            transition-duration: .4s, .5s, .6s;
        }
    
        Answer = .5s


    Given the CSS below, how will the browser display the transition?
        .card {
          transition-property: background;
          transition-duration: .4s;
        }

        .card:hover {
          background: lightyellow;
        }

    Answer = The background transitions to lightyellow on hover, then transitions back
             to the original color on hover-off.
